### BlastDiffusion: A Latent Diffusion Model for Generating Synthetic Embryo Images to Address Data Scarcity in In Vitro Fertilization

**[Code](#)** | **[Publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-98688-8_15)**

![Project Image](Methodology.jpg)

Accurately identifying oocytes that progress to the **blastocyst stage** is crucial in reproductive medicine.  
We propose **BlastDiffusion**, a **generative model based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)**, which synthesizes realistic oocyte images **conditioned on developmental outcomes**, addressing the challenges of limited annotated embryo datasets.

#### Key Highlights
- Utilizes a **pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE)** for latent space representation combined with a diffusion process to generate realistic images.  
- Produces synthetic images that differentiate **oocytes that reach the blastocyst stage** from those that do not.  
- Achieves superior performance compared to GAN-based models
- Qualitative analysis shows the model captures **key morphological differences** linked to developmental outcomes.  
- Demonstrates the **potential of diffusion models** for **data augmentation** and **automated embryo assessment** in IVF.
  

### **Enhancing Image Retrieval Performance with Generative Models in Siamese Networks**  
**[Code](https://github.com/cvblab/CBIR_SYNTHETIC_VIEWS)** | **[Publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10896802)**  

![Project Image](Methodology_JBHI.jpg)  

This research addresses the challenges of **prostate cancer diagnosis**, one of the most prevalent cancers among men worldwide.  
We propose a **Siamese Network** approach to encode image patches into latent representations for **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)** tasks, leveraging **generative deep learning models** to improve retrieval quality.  

Key highlights:
- Leveraging the **ProGleason-GAN** framework trained on the **SiCAPv2 dataset** for generating synthetic patches.  
- Achieved **notable improvements** in retrieval metrics with synthetic data augmentation.  
- First approach where **CBIR-optimized latent representations** are used to train an attention mechanism for **Gleason Scoring** of Whole Slide Images (WSI).

### ProGleason-GAN: Conditional Progressive Growing GAN for Prostatic Cancer Gleason Grade Patch Synthesis

**[Code](https://github.com/cvblab/ProGleason-GAN)** | **[Publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260723003607)**

![Project Image](path_to_image.jpg)

This research focuses on **prostate cancer**, one of the most common diseases affecting men worldwide.  
We propose **ProGleason-GAN**, a **conditional Progressive Growing GAN** designed to **synthesize histopathological patches** of prostate tissue for **data augmentation**, addressing the challenges of **insufficient and unbalanced datasets** in Gleason grading models.

Key Highlights
- Conditional GAN architecture capable of generating patches for **non-cancerous patterns, GG3, GG4, and GG5** by embedding Gleason grade information.
- External validation performed by **expert pathologists** confirmed the realism of the synthetic samples.  
- Significant improvement in **classification performance** on the **SiCAPv2 dataset** with synthetic data augmentation.
